# Dynamic Accessibility Measurement

## Overview
This research project focuses on analyzing human mobility data from SafeGraph to study accessibility changes in response to extreme events. By examining data before, during, and after the event, this project aims to identify trends in community resilience and recovery.

## Data
The dataset was sourced from [Safegraph], containing anonymized visits of Point-of-Interests (POI). The data includes:
- POI information
- Location
- Visits counts
- Temporal aspects/ Date range

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the data
2. Quantifying accessibility metricss for communities.
3. Trend analysis: Examining communities response patterns during different phases of the event.

## Results
Key insights included:
- Changes in accessibility metrics pre- and post-event.
- Variations in community resilience.
