# Dynamic Accessibility Measurement

## Overview
This project is part of my bachelor's graduation thesis. It focuses on analyzing human mobility data to study accessibility changes in response to extreme events. By examining mobility data before, during, and after the event, this project aims to identify trends in community resilience and recovery. The accessibility to gas station of each census block group in the study area before, during, and after a hurricane event is calculated.

## Data
The dataset was sourced from [Safegraph], containing anonymized visits of Point-of-Interests (POI). The data includes:
- POI information
- Location
- Visits counts
- Date range

## Methodology
1. Data preprocessing: Cleaning and organizing the data.
2. Quantifying accessibility metrics for communities.
3. Trend analysis: Examining communities response patterns during different phases of the event.

In this project, accessibility metric indicating how accessible is a certain services to a community based on the number of visit of certain category of POI in the area.

## Results
Key insights included:
- Changes in accessibility metrics pre- and post-event.
- Variations in community resilience.
